Create a new text file called /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf with your favorite text editor containing the following text. Since this file resides in the /etc folder and not your home directory, you need root or sudo access to create or edit this file:

Section "Device"

Identifier "card0"

Driver "intel"

Option "AccelMethod" "uxa"

EndSection

hope this helps
